# AimbotV1.1
Simple aimbot script with smooth transition to the closest players to reduce the chance of getting banned, with highlight esp to all players, only for FFA Mode. 

> [!CAUTION]
> If you're getting banned from the game, it's not my fault but you are, if you want to be pro then don't use script to win.

Loadstring script:
