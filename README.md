# Aimbot V1.1
Simple aimbot script with smooth transition and 80% Accuracy aim to the closest players to reduce the chance of getting banned, with highlight esp to all players, only for FFA Mode. 

_**To edit the smoothness of the aimbot, edit the files "Aimbot.lua" and then scroll down to line 93 after that scroll right and you will see the value 0.2, thats the default value, below is the recommended value**_

$$\boxed{\color{GREEN}\ VALUE \space \color{GREEN} :}$$
- 0.1 = Super Smooth (60%) ```I```
- 0.2 = Smooth (75%)```II```
- 0.3 = Medium (83%) ```III```
- 0.4 = Auto Lock (Risk! 90%)```IV```

> [!CAUTION]
> Value higher than that can be easily detected.

> [!WARNING]
> _If you're getting banned from the game, it's not my fault but you are, if you want to be pro then don't use script to win_
>
> Aimbot accuracy is only reduced by 25% (but you can edit it), without smooth transition and reduced accuracy of the aim, it's easy to be detected by other players/server that you are using an aimbot.

Loadstring script: 

`loadstring(game:HttpGet('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vzexg-2/AimbotV1.1/main/Aimbot/B1/C2/K3/L8/13X/Aimbot.lua'))()`

if its not working try copying it manually without the loadstring
